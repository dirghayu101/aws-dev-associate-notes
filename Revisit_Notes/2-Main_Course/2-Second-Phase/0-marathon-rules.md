# Rules for marathon:
- Don't stop keep going. If you miss something, note it down for later.
- 1 folder for each 90 minute session.
- marathon will follow numbering.
- Make notes as fast as possible.
- Simple rule. 90 minutes of marathon should have 90 minutes of videos covered. 
- 90 minutes run + 30 minutes recuperation.
- Two marathon will cover the target 3 hour of video lecture. The last marathon is for trying to do demo lessons alongside Cantrill.
- If you aren't able to complete labs in the last session, leave it, we will get back to it later.
