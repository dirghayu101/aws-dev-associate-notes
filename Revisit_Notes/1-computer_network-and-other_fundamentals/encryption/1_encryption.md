Encryption types:
-> At rest.
-> At transit.


Terminologies used when talking about encryption:
1. Plan Text
2. Algorithm
3. Key
4. Cipher-text

With symmetric encryption the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

An asymmetric encryption has two keys public and private. 

Now the public key can only encrypt the data, whereas the private can only decrypt the data. So, public key is sent to encrypt the data in transit and the owner of public key sender will have the private key to decrypt the data.

Asymmetric encryption is computer intensive i.e. it requires a lot of computation.
