# Quick Pointers that I am forgetting:
- Physical Layer device typical example is Hub. And the data will be in their bit form. Collision takes place.
- Data Link layer's device example is Switch. Switch is relatively intelligent. There are measures to solve collision of data stream. Data is called frame in this. It also has MAC address so devices can be uniquely identified.
- Layer 1 and Layer 2 i.e. Physical and Data Link layers haven't been standardized. There are no standard protocols or header structure for these. But starting after those, most layers have some common communication protocol. 
- Network Layer's device is router. Data is broken down into IP Packets in this. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) takes place here.
