As you already know DNS is like a dictionary storing domain name and their corresponding IP addresses.

# DNS terminologies:
1. 


DNS Root: Pointing to the name server hosting the TLD zones.

Top Level Domain: Like .com, .in, .uk, etc.

The answer of DNS query is either authoritative or non-authoritative. If the answer is being returned from a cache storage like DNS resolver then there is a possibility that the IP address of the domain you are looking for might have changed.
